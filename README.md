# DayZ Log Cleanup & Auto-Launcher Script for DZSALauncher

This script is for DayZ players using **DZSALauncher** who are tired of DayZ filling up their disk with log files (`.rpt`, `.mdmp`, `.log`).  
It automatically deletes unnecessary log files before AND after you play.

---

## üîß What does this script do?
‚úÖ Deletes old DayZ logs (`.rpt`, `.mdmp`, `.log`) BEFORE starting DZSALauncher.  
‚úÖ Launches **DZSALauncher.exe** so you can start DayZ normally.  
‚úÖ Waits for **DayZ_x64.exe** to run.  
‚úÖ When you exit DayZ, it automatically cleans up logs AGAIN.
